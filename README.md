# EfficiencyBoost-AI_Model
EfficiencyBooster website helps users to enhance their work efficiency by providing them the priority order in which they should perform their tasks. It also provides a descriptive schedule for different tasks as well.üòä 

The main objective of my EfficiencyBoost model is to help the users to prioritise their works based on different input fields filled by the user in my website.
It also aims to provide a time-bounded schedule to users based on their energy level and concentration level during the whole course of their day.
As users get the best schedule for performing different tasks, it helps them to optimise their time.
As employees efficiently perform their tasks, it will also help them to maintain work-life balance.üëç

Real World Applications- üòä

1. Personal Productivity:
Individuals can use the model to analyze their daily schedules, identify productivity bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to optimize their time and energy.

2. Employee Performance:
Organizations can utilize the model to evaluate employee work efficiency and identify areas for improvement.
It can assist in designing personalized training programs, optimizing work schedules, and enhancing employee engagement and job satisfaction.

3. Freelancers and Independent Professionals:
Freelancers and independent professionals can benefit from the model by understanding their peak productivity hours and aligning their work schedules accordingly.
It can help them optimize their time and energy utilization, leading to increased efficiency and client satisfaction.

Working-
1. User will be asked to fill some fields in the website related to tasks he/she need to perform.
2. The various fields include task name, task category, percentage of task completed and deadline of that task.
3. My website will provide him/her a priority order to perform the tasks so that work efficiency will boost.
4. It will also provide him/her a oersonalise schedule which includes date, task name and time of the day for each task to be performed.

Thank you judges and Devfolio for allowing me to challenge myself in this mega Hackathon and submit my ML model.üòä
